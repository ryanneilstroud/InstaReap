# Reap Coding Challenge

Project utilizing React Native to demonstrate cross platform support.

## Prerequisites

Please ensure your have React Native CLI, node.js, and java installed.

### Installing

After getting React Native installed and all the prequisities you can run
  
    $ npx react-native run-ios
   
and

    $ npx react-native run-android

Note that I've been working with an M1 machine and several tools are yet to be supported natively. I recommend using Rosetta 2 when you can. 
You can also find Android emulator support through Android Studio Preview.

## Running the tests

    $ npm test
